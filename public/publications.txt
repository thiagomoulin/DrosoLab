AB  - More than 320 million people live with depression in the world, a disorder that 
      severely limits psychosocial functioning and diminishes quality of life. The 
      prevalence of major depression is almost two times higher in women than in men. 
      However, the molecular mechanisms of its sex-specific pathophysiology are still 
      poorly understood. Drosophila melanogaster is an established model for 
      neurobiological research of depression-like states, as well as for the study of 
      molecular and genetic sex differences in the brain. Here, we investigated 
      sex-specific effects on forced-climbing locomotion (negative geotaxis) and gene 
      expression of a fly model of depression-like phenotypes induced by levodopa 
      administration, which was previously shown to impair normal food intake, mating 
      frequency, and serotonin concentration. We observed that both males and females 
      show deficits in the forced-climbing paradigm; however, modulated by distinct 
      gene expression patterns after levodopa administration. Our results suggest that 
      Drosophila models can be a valuable tool for identifying the molecular mechanisms 
      underlying the difference of depressive disorder prevalence between men and 
      women.

      deleterious effects in human cancer cells.

AB  - Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has been widely documented to affect various 
      aspects of health, including development, metabolism and neuronal function in a 
      variety of organisms. Despite numerous reports detailing these effects, a 
      comprehensive mechanistic model remains elusive, especially with regard to the 
      long-term effects of PFOA, as it bioaccumulates in food chains with a long 
      half-life. In this study, we evaluated the impact of PFOA on several critical 
      physiological states of Drosophila melanogaster. Our findings indicate that PFOA 
      exposure significantly decreases reproductive capacity and induces alterations in 
      starvation resistance and feeding behavior in flies. Interestingly, PFOA exposure 
      also caused changes in locomotor activity and sleep patterns compared with flies 
      receiving a standard diet. Notably, compared with controls, the F2 generation 
      showed increased locomotion and shorter sleep duration during the dark phase, 
      even without direct exposure to PFOA, indicating possible transgenerational 
      effects. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that PFOA also disrupts fatty acid 
      metabolism and alters the expression of immune-responsive genes in Drosophila. In 
      the U-2 OS human osteosarcoma cell line, we examined the impact of PFOA on 
      circadian rhythm regulatory proteins and discovered that, compared with controls, 
      BMAL1 levels increased at concentrations from 10 nM to 10 μM. In summary, this 
      research highlights the influence of PFOA on diverse biological processes, 
      including reproduction, feeding behavior, starvation resistance, locomotion, and 
      sleep activity in Drosophila. It also highlights the ability of PFOA to alter 
      BMAL1 expression patterns in human osteosarcoma cells with deleterious effects.

AB  - The assessment of behavioral outcomes is a central component of neuroscientific 
      research, which has required continuous technological innovations to produce more 
      detailed and reliable findings. In this article, we provide an in-depth review on 
      the progress and future implications for three model organisms (mouse, rat, and 
      Drosophila) essential to our current understanding of behavior. By compiling a 
      comprehensive catalog of popular assays, we are able to compare the diversity of 
      tasks and usage of these animal models in behavioral research. This compilation 
      also allows for the evaluation of existing state-of-the-art methods and 
      experimental applications, including optogenetics, machine learning, and 
      high-throughput behavioral assays. We go on to discuss novel apparatuses and 
      inter-species analyses for centrophobism, feeding behavior, aggression and mating 
      paradigms, with the goal of providing a unique view on comparative behavioral 
      research. The challenges and recent advances are evaluated in terms of their 
      translational value, ethical procedures, and trustworthiness for behavioral 
      research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Like most living organisms, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster 
      exhibits strong and diverse behavioural reactions to light. Drosophila is a 
      diurnal animal that displays both short- and long-term responses to light, 
      important for, instance, in avoidance and light wavelength preference, regulation 
      of eclosion, courtship, and activity, and provides an important model organism 
      for understanding the regulation of circadian rhythms both at molecular and 
      circuit levels. However, the assessment and comparison of light-based behaviours 
      is still a challenge, mainly due to the lack of a standardised platform to 
      measure behaviour and different protocols created across studies. Here, we 
      describe the Drosophila Interactive System for Controlled Optical manipulations 
      (DISCO), a low-cost, automated, high-throughput device that records the flies' 
      activity using infrared beams while performing LED light manipulations. RESULTS: 
      To demonstrate the effectiveness of this tool and validate its potential as a 
      standard platform, we developed a number of distinct assays, including measuring 
      the locomotor response of flies exposed to sudden darkness (lights-off) stimuli. 
      Both white-eyed and red-eyed wild-type flies exhibit increased activity after the 
      application of stimuli, while no changes can be observed in Fmr1 null allele 
      flies, a model of fragile X syndrome. Next, to demonstrate the use of DISCO in 
      long-term protocols, we monitored the circadian rhythm of the flies for 48 h 
      while performing an alcohol preference test. We show that increased alcohol 
      consumption happens intermittently throughout the day, especially in the dark 
      phases. Finally, we developed a feedback-loop algorithm to implement a place 
      preference test based on the flies' innate aversion to blue light and preference 
      for green light. We show that both white-eyed and red-eyed wild-type flies were 
      able to learn to avoid the blue-illuminated zones. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      demonstrate the versatility of DISCO for a range of protocols, indicating that 
      this platform can be used in a variety of ways to study light-dependent 
      behaviours in flies.

TI  - The Statin Target Hmgcr Regulates Energy Metabolism and Food Intake through 
      Central Mechanisms.
LID - 10.3390/cells11060970 [doi]
LID - 970
AB  - The statin drug target, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), is 
      strongly linked to body mass index (BMI), yet how HMGCR influences BMI is not 
      understood. In mammals, studies of peripheral HMGCR have not clearly identified a 
      role in BMI maintenance and, despite considerable central nervous system 
      expression, a function for central HMGCR has not been determined. Similar to 
      mammals, Hmgcr is highly expressed in the Drosophila melanogaster brain. 
      Therefore, genetic and pharmacological studies were performed to identify how 
      central Hmgcr regulates Drosophila energy metabolism and feeding behavior. We 
      found that inhibiting Hmgcr, in insulin-producing cells of the Drosophila pars 
      intercerebralis (PI), the fly hypothalamic equivalent, significantly reduces the 
      expression of insulin-like peptides, severely decreasing insulin signaling. In 
      fact, reducing Hmgcr expression throughout development causes decreased body 
      size, increased lipid storage, hyperglycemia, and hyperphagia. Furthermore, the 
      Hmgcr induced hyperphagia phenotype requires a conserved insulin-regulated 
      α-glucosidase, target of brain insulin (tobi). In rats and mice, acute inhibition 
      of hypothalamic Hmgcr activity stimulates food intake. This study presents 
      evidence of how central Hmgcr regulation of metabolism and food intake could 
      influence BMI.

AB  - Several reports suggest obesity and bipolar disorder (BD) share some 
      physiological and behavioural similarities. For instance, obese individuals are 
      more impulsive and have heightened reward responsiveness, phenotypes associated 
      with BD, while bipolar patients become obese at a higher rate and earlier age 
      than people without BD; however, the molecular mechanisms of such an association 
      remain obscure. Here we demonstrate, using whole transcriptome analysis, that 
      Drosophila Ets96B, homologue of obesity-linked gene ETV5, regulates cellular 
      systems associated with obesity and BD. Consistent with a role in obesity and BD, 
      loss of nervous system Ets96B during development increases triacylglyceride 
      concentration, while inducing a heightened startle-response, as well as 
      increasing hyperactivity and reducing sleep. Of notable interest, mouse Etv5 and 
      Drosophila Ets96B are expressed in dopaminergic-rich regions, and loss of Ets96B 
      specifically in dopaminergic neurons recapitulates the metabolic and behavioural 
      phenotypes. Moreover, our data indicate Ets96B inhibits dopaminergic-specific 
      neuroprotective systems. Additionally, we reveal that multiple SNPs in human ETV5 
      link to body mass index (BMI) and BD, providing further evidence for ETV5 as an 
      important and novel molecular intermediate between obesity and BD. We identify a 
      novel molecular link between obesity and bipolar disorder. The Drosophila ETV5 
      homologue Ets96B regulates the expression of cellular systems with links to 
      obesity and behaviour, including the expression of a conserved endoplasmic 
      reticulum molecular chaperone complex known to be neuroprotective. Finally, a 
      connection between the obesity-linked gene ETV5 and bipolar disorder emphasizes a 
      functional relationship between obesity and BD at the molecular level.

AB  - People are constantly exposed to phthalates, due to their common use in the 
      production of plastics, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and skin care products. The 
      ability of phthalates to disrupt endocrine signaling, leading to developmental, 
      reproductive and metabolic defects, has been studied, yet how phthalates 
      interfere with these biological functions is still unclear. To uncover DBP 
      interacting molecular pathways, we raised Drosophila melanogaster on food 
      containing dibutyl phthalate (DBP) at various concentrations. Whole transcriptome 
      analysis of adult Drosophila reveals that DBP exposure throughout development 
      disrupts the expression of genes central to circadian rhythm regulation, 
      including increased expression of vrille (vri, human NFIL3), timeless (tim, human 
      TIMELESS) and period (per, human PER3), with decreased expression of 
      Pigment-dispersing factor (Pdf). DBP exposure also alters the expression of the 
      evolutionarily conserved nuclear receptor Hormone receptor-like in 38 (Hr38, 
      human NR4A2), which is known to regulate Pdf expression. Furthermore, behavioral 
      assays determined that exposing Drosophila to DBP throughout development modifies 
      the circadian rhythm of adults. Although DBP inhibits the expression of signaling 
      systems regulating vision, including Rh5 and Rh6, two light-sensing G-protein 
      coupled receptors involved in the daily resetting of circadian rhythm, it does 
      not influence eye development. Circadian rhythm genes are well conserved from 
      flies to humans; therefore, we tested the effect of DBP exposure on human breast 
      cells (MCF10A) and demonstrate that, similar to the fruit fly model, this 
      exposure disrupts circadian rhythm (BMAL1 expression) at doses that promote the 
      proliferation and migration ability of MCF10A cells. Our results are the first to 
      provide comprehensive evidence that DBP interferes with circadian rhythm in both 
      adult Drosophila and human cells, which may help to explain the broad 
      physiological action of phthalates.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies have identified a number of genes associated with 
      human body weight. While some of these genes are large fields within obesity 
      research, such as MC4R, POMC, FTO and BDNF, the majority do not have a clearly 
      defined functional role explaining why they may affect body weight. Here, we 
      searched biological databases and discovered 33 additional genes associated with 
      human obesity (CADM2, GIPR, GPCR5B, LRP1B, NEGR1, NRXN3, SH2B1, FANCL, GNPDA2, 
      HMGCR, MAP2K5, NUDT3, PRKD1, QPCTL, TNNI3K, MTCH2, DNAJC27, SLC39A8, MTIF3, 
      RPL27A, SEC16B, ETV5, HMGA1, TFAP2B, TUB, ZNF608, FAIM2, KCTD15, LINGO2, POC5, 
      PTBP2, TMEM18, TMEM160). We find that the majority have orthologues in distant 
      species, such as D. melanogaster and C. elegans, suggesting that they are 
      important for the biology of most bilateral species. Intriguingly, signalling 
      cascade genes and transcription factors are enriched among these obesity genes, 
      and several of the genes show properties that could be useful for potential drug 
      discovery. In this review, we demonstrate how information from several distant 
      model species, interactomics and signalling pathway analysis represents an 
      important way to better understand the functional diversity of the surprisingly 
      high number of molecules that seem to be important for human obesity.

PG  - 233-43
LID - 10.1530/JOE-16-0040 [doi]
AB  - Transmembrane protein 18 (TMEM18) is an ill-described, obesity-related gene, but 
      few studies have explored its molecular function. We found single-nucleotide 
      polymorphism data, suggesting that TMEM18 may be involved in the 
      regulation/physiology of metabolic syndrome based on associations with insulin, 
      homeostatic model assessment-β (HOMAβ), triglycerides, and blood sugar. We then 
      found an ortholog in the Drosophila genome, knocked down Drosophila Tmem18 
      specifically in insulin-producing cells, and tested for its effects on metabolic 
      function. Our results suggest that TMEM18 affects substrate levels through 
      insulin and glucagon signaling, and its downregulation induces a metabolic state 
      resembling type 2 diabetes. This work is the first to experimentally describe the 
      metabolic consequences of TMEM18 knockdown, and further supports its association 
      with obesity.

TI  - Evidence for Prepulse Inhibition of Visually Evoked Motor Response in Drosophila 
      melanogaster.

AB  - Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is a widely investigated behavior to study the 
      mechanisms of disorders such as anxiety, schizophrenia, and bipolar mania. PPI 
      has been observed across various vertebrate and invertebrate species; however, it 
      has not yet been reported in adult Drosophila melanogaster. In this study, we 
      describe the first detection of PPI of visually evoked locomotor arousal in 
      flies. To validate our findings, we demonstrate that PPI in Drosophila can be 
      partially reverted by the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK-801, 
      known for inducing sensorimotor gating deficits in rodent models. Additionally, 
      we show that the visually evoked response can be inhibited by multiple stimuli 
      presentation, which can also be affected by MK-801. Given the versatility of 
      Drosophila as a model organism for genetic screening and analysis, our results 
      suggest that high-throughput behavioral screenings of adult flies can become a 
      valuable tool for investigating the mechanisms behind PPI.

TI  - The Drosophila Kctd-family homologue Kctd12-like modulates male aggression and 
      mating behaviour.
PG  - 2513-26
LID - 10.1111/ejn.12619 [doi]
AB  - In Drosophila, serotonin (5-HT) regulates aggression, mating behaviour and 
      sleep/wake behaviour through different receptors. Currently, how these various 
      receptors are themselves regulated is still not completely understood. The 
      KCTD12-family of proteins, which have been shown to modify G-protein-coupled 
      receptor (GPCR) signalling in mammals, are one possibility of auxiliary proteins 
      modulating 5-HT receptor signalling. The KCTD12-family was found to be remarkably 
      conserved and present in species from C. elegans to humans. The Drosophila KCTD12 
      homologue Kctd12-like (Ktl) was highly expressed in both the larval and adult 
      CNS. By performing behavioural assays in male Drosophila, we now reveal that Ktl 
      is required for proper male aggression and mating behaviour. Previously, it was 
      shown that Ktl is in a complex with the Drosophila 5-HT receptor 5-HT7, and we 
      observed that both Ktl and the 5-HT1A receptor are required in insulin-producing 
      cells (IPCs) for proper adult male behaviour, as well as for hyperaggressive 
      activity induced by the mammalian 5-HT1A receptor agonist 
      8-hydroxy-2-dipropylaminotetralin-hydrobromide. Finally, we show that Ktl 
      expression in the IPCs is necessary to regulate locomotion and normal sleep/wake 
      patterns in Drosophila, but not the 5-HT1A receptor. Similar to what was observed 
      with mammalian KCTD12-family members that interact physically with a GPCR 
      receptor to regulate desensitization, in Drosophila Ktl may function in GPCR 5-HT 
      receptor pathways to regulate their signalling, which is required for proper 
      adult male behaviour.

TI  - The Statin Target HMG-Coenzyme a Reductase (Hmgcr) Regulates Sleep Homeostasis in 
      Drosophila.
LID - 10.3390/ph15010079 [doi]
LID - 79
AB  - Statins, HMG Coenzyme A Reductase (HMGCR) inhibitors, are a first-line therapy, 
      used to reduce hypercholesterolemia and the risk for cardiovascular events. While 
      sleep disturbances are recognized as a side-effect of statin treatment, the 
      impact of statins on sleep is under debate. Using Drosophila, we discovered a 
      novel role for Hmgcr in sleep modulation. Loss of pan-neuronal Hmgcr expression 
      affects fly sleep behavior, causing a decrease in sleep latency and an increase 
      in sleep episode duration. We localized the pars intercerebralis (PI), equivalent 
      to the mammalian hypothalamus, as the region within the fly brain requiring Hmgcr 
      activity for proper sleep maintenance. Lack of Hmgcr expression in the PI 
      insulin-producing cells recapitulates the sleep effects of pan-neuronal Hmgcr 
      knockdown. Conversely, loss of Hmgcr in a different PI subpopulation, the 
      corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) homologue-expressing neurons (DH44 neurons), 
      increases sleep latency and decreases sleep duration. The requirement for Hmgcr 
      activity in different neurons signifies its importance in sleep regulation. 
      Interestingly, loss of Hmgcr in the PI does not affect circadian rhythm, 
      suggesting that Hmgcr regulates sleep by pathways distinct from the circadian 
      clock. Taken together, these findings suggest that Hmgcr activity in the PI is 
      essential for proper sleep homeostasis in flies.

LID - 10.3390/biomedicines11113032 [doi]
LID - 3032
AB  - Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors, commonly known as gliptins, have been 
      an integral part of the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for several 
      years. Despite their remarkable efficacy in lowering glucose levels and their 
      compatibility with other hypoglycemic drugs, recent studies have revealed adverse 
      effects, prompting the search for improved drugs within this category, which has 
      required the use of animal models to verify the hypoglycemic effects of these 
      compounds. Currently, in many countries the use of mammals is being significantly 
      restricted, as well as cost prohibitive, and alternative in vivo approaches have 
      been encouraged. In this sense, Drosophila has emerged as a promising alternative 
      for several compelling reasons: it is cost-effective, offers high experimental 
      throughput, is genetically manipulable, and allows the assessment of 
      multigenerational effects, among other advantages. In this study, we present 
      evidence that diprotin A, a DPP4 inhibitor, effectively reduces glucose levels in 
      Drosophila hemolymph. This discovery underscores the potential of Drosophila as 
      an initial screening tool for novel compounds directed against DPP4 enzymatic 
      activity.

AB  - Lack of quality sleep increases central nervous system oxidative stress and 
      impairs removal of neurotoxic soluble metabolites from brain parenchyma. During 
      aging poor sleep quality, caused by sleep fragmentation, increases central 
      nervous system cellular stress. Currently, it is not known how organisms offset 
      age-related cytotoxic metabolite increases in order to safeguard neuronal 
      survival. Furthermore, it is not understood how age and sleep fragmentation 
      interact to affect oxidative stress protection pathways. We demonstrate sleep 
      fragmentation increases systems that protect against oxidative damage and 
      neuroprotective endoplasmic reticulum molecular chaperones, as well as neuronal 
      insulin and dopaminergic expression in middle-aged Drosophila males. 
      Interestingly, even after sleep recovery the expression of these genes was still 
      upregulated in middle-aged flies. Finally, sleep fragmentation generates higher 
      levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in middle-aged flies and after sleep 
      recovery these levels remain significantly higher than in young flies. The fact 
      that neuroprotective pathways remain upregulated in middle-aged flies beyond 
      sleep fragmentation suggests it might represent a strong stressor for the brain 
      during later life.

      mechanisms for SIM. We observe that chronic fluvastatin treatment causes reduced 
      general locomotion activity and climbing ability. In addition, transmission 
      microscopy of dissected skeletal muscles of fluvastatin-treated flies reveals 
      strong myofibrillar damage, including increased sarcomere lengths and Z-line 
      streaming, which are reminiscent of myopathy, along with fragmented mitochondria 
      of larger sizes, most of which are round-like shapes. Furthermore, chronic 
      fluvastatin treatment is associated with impaired lipid metabolism and insulin 
      signalling. Mechanistically, knockdown of the statin-target Hmgcr in the skeletal 
      muscles recapitulates fluvastatin-induced mitochondrial phenotypes and lowered 
      general locomotion activity; however, it was not sufficient to alter sarcomere 
      length or elicit myofibrillar damage compared to controls or fluvastatin 
      treatment. Moreover, we found that fluvastatin treatment was associated with 
      reduced expression of the skeletal muscle chloride channel, ClC-a (Drosophila 
      homolog of CLCN1), while selective knockdown of skeletal muscle ClC-a also 
      recapitulated fluvastatin-induced myofibril damage and increased sarcomere 
      lengths. Surprisingly, exercising fluvastatin-treated flies restored ClC-a 
      expression and normalized sarcomere lengths, suggesting that fluvastatin-induced 
      myofibrillar phenotypes could be linked to lowered ClC-a expression. Taken 
      together, these results may indicate the potential role of ClC-a inhibition in 
      statin-associated muscular phenotypes. This study underlines the importance of 
      Drosophila melanogaster as a powerful model system for elucidating the locomotion 
      and muscular phenotypes, promoting a better understanding of the molecular 
      mechanisms underlying SIM.

TI  - Effects of Transient Administration of the NMDA Receptor Antagonist MK-801 in 
      Drosophila melanogaster Activity, Sleep, and Negative Geotaxis.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines11010192 [doi]
LID - 192
AB  - MK-801, also called dizocilpine, is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor 
      antagonist widely used in animal research to model schizophrenia-like phenotypes. 
      Although its effects in rodents are well characterised, little is known about the 
      outcomes of this drug in other organisms. In this study, we characterise the 
      effects of MK-801 on the locomotion, sleep, and negative geotaxis of the fruit 
      fly Drosophila melanogaster. We observed that acute (24 h) and chronic (7 days) 
      administration of MK-801 enhanced negative geotaxis activity in the forced 
      climbing assay for all tested concentrations (0.15 mM, 0.3 mM, and 0.6 mM). 
      Moreover, acute administration, but not chronic, increased the flies' locomotion 
      in a dose-dependent matter. Finally, average sleep duration was not affected by 
      any concentration or administration protocol. Our results indicate that acute 
      MK-801 could be used to model hyperactivity phenotypes in Drosophila 
      melanogaster. Overall, this study provides further evidence that the NMDA 
      receptor system is functionally conserved in flies, suggesting the usefulness of 
      this model to investigate several phenotypes as a complement and replacement of 
      the rodent models within drug discovery.

TI  - CCAP regulates feeding behavior via the NPF pathway in Drosophila adults.
PG  - 7401-7408
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1914037117 [doi]
AB  - The intake of macronutrients is crucial for the fitness of any animal and is 
      mainly regulated by peripheral signals to the brain. How the brain receives and 
      translates these peripheral signals or how these interactions lead to changes in 
      feeding behavior is not well-understood. We discovered that 2 crustacean 
      cardioactive peptide (CCAP)-expressing neurons in Drosophila adults regulate 
      feeding behavior and metabolism. Notably, loss of CCAP, or knocking down the CCAP 
      receptor (CCAP-R) in 2 dorsal median neurons, inhibits the release of 
      neuropeptide F (NPF), which regulates feeding behavior. Furthermore, under 
      starvation conditions, flies normally have an increased sensitivity to sugar; 
      however, loss of CCAP, or CCAP-R in 2 dorsal median NPF neurons, inhibited sugar 
      sensitivity in satiated and starved flies. Separate from its regulation of NPF 
      signaling, the CCAP peptide also regulates triglyceride levels. Additionally, 
      genetic and optogenetic studies demonstrate that CCAP signaling is necessary and 
      sufficient to stimulate a reflexive feeding behavior, the proboscis extension 
      reflex (PER), elicited when external food cues are interpreted as palatable. 
      Dopaminergic signaling was also sufficient to induce a PER. On the other hand, 
      although necessary, NPF neurons were not able to induce a PER. These data 
      illustrate that the CCAP peptide is a central regulator of feeding behavior and 
      metabolism in adult flies, and that NPF neurons have an important regulatory role 
      within this system.

TI  - Obesity-linked homologues TfAP-2 and Twz establish meal frequency in Drosophila 
      melanogaster.

AB  - In all animals managing the size of individual meals and frequency of feeding is 
      crucial for metabolic homeostasis. In the current study we demonstrate that the 
      noradrenalin analogue octopamine and the cholecystokinin (CCK) homologue 
      Drosulfakinin (Dsk) function downstream of TfAP-2 and Tiwaz (Twz) to control the 
      number of meals in adult flies. Loss of TfAP-2 or Twz in octopaminergic neurons 
      increased the size of individual meals, while overexpression of TfAP-2 
      significantly decreased meal size and increased feeding frequency. Of note, our 
      study reveals that TfAP-2 and Twz regulate octopamine signaling to initiate 
      feeding; then octopamine, in a negative feedback loop, induces expression of Dsk 
      to inhibit consummatory behavior. Intriguingly, we found that the mouse TfAP-2 
      and Twz homologues, AP-2β and Kctd15, co-localize in areas of the brain known to 
      regulate feeding behavior and reward, and a proximity ligation assay (PLA) 
      demonstrated that AP-2β and Kctd15 interact directly in a mouse 
      hypothalamus-derived cell line. Finally, we show that in this mouse hypothalamic 
      cell line AP-2β and Kctd15 directly interact with Ube2i, a mouse sumoylation 
      enzyme, and that AP-2β may itself be sumoylated. Our study reveals how two 
      obesity-linked homologues regulate metabolic homeostasis by modulating 
      consummatory behavior.

TI  - Multidrug Resistance Like Protein 1 Activity in Malpighian Tubules Regulates 
      Lipid Homeostasis in Drosophila.
LID - 10.3390/membranes11060432 [doi]
LID - 432
AB  - Multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs), members of the ATP-binding cassette 
      transporter (ABC transporter) family, are pivotal for transporting endo- and 
      xenobiotics, which confer resistance to anticancer agents and contribute to the 
      clearance of oxidative products. However, their function in many biological 
      processes is still unclear. We investigated the role of an evolutionarily 
      conserved MRP in metabolic homeostasis by knocking down the expression of 
      Drosophila multidrug-resistance like protein 1 (MRP) in several tissues involved 
      in regulating metabolism, including the gut, fat body, and Malpighian tubules. 
      Interestingly, only suppression of MRP in the Malpighian tubules, the functional 
      equivalent to the human kidney, was sufficient to cause abnormal lipid 
      accumulation and disrupt feeding behavior. Furthermore, reduced Malpighian tubule 
      MRP expression resulted in increased Hr96 (homolog of human pregnane X receptor) 
      expression. Hr96 is known to play a role in detoxification and lipid metabolism 
      processes. Reduced expression of MRP in the Malpighian tubules also conveyed 
      resistance to oxidative stress, as well as reduced normal levels of reactive 
      oxygen species in adult flies. This study reveals that an evolutionarily 
      conserved MRP is required in Drosophila Malpighian tubules for proper metabolic 
      homeostasis.

AB  - Previously, we showed that fluvastatin treatment induces myofibrillar damage and 
      mitochondrial phenotypes in the skeletal muscles of Drosophila. However, the 
      sequential occurrence of mitochondrial phenotypes and myofibril damage remains 
      elusive. To address this, we treated flies with fluvastatin for two and five days 
      and examined their thorax flight muscles using confocal microscopy. In the 
      two-day fluvastatin group, compared to the control, thorax flight muscles 
      exhibited mitochondrial morphological changes, including fragmentation, rounding 
      up and reduced content, while myofibrils remained organized in parallel. In the 
      five-day fluvastatin treatment, not only did mitochondrial morphological changes 
      become more pronounced, but myofibrils became severely disorganized with 
      significantly increased thickness and spacing, along with myofilament 
      abnormalities, suggesting myofibril damage. These findings suggest that 
      fluvastatin-induced mitochondrial changes precede myofibril damage. Moreover, in 
      the five-day fluvastatin group, the mitochondria demonstrated elevated H(2)O(2) 
      and impaired fatty acid oxidation compared to the control group, indicating 
      potential mitochondrial dysfunction. Surprisingly, knocking down Hmgcr 
      (Drosophila homolog of HMGCR) showed normal mitochondrial respiration in all 
      parameters compared to controls or five-day fluvastatin treatment, which suggests 
      that fluvastatin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction might be independent of Hmgcr 
      inhibition. These results provide insights into the sequential occurrence of 
      mitochondria and myofibril damage in statin-induced myopathy for future studies.

AB  - All multicellular organisms require the ability to regulate bodily processes in 
      order to maintain a stable condition, which necessitates fluctuations in internal 
      metabolics, as well as modifications of outward behaviour. Understanding the 
      genetics behind this modulation is important as a general model for the metabolic 
      modification of behaviour. This study demonstrates that the activity of the small 
      GTPase Rac2 is required in Drosophila for the proper regulation of lipid storage 
      and feeding behaviour, as well as aggression and mating behaviours. Rac2 mutant 
      males and females are susceptible to starvation and contain considerably less 
      lipids than controls. Furthermore, Rac2 mutants also have disrupted feeding 
      behaviour, eating fewer but larger meals than controls. Intriguingly, Rac2 mutant 
      males rarely initiate aggressive behaviour and display significantly increased 
      levels of courtship behaviour towards other males and mated females. From these 
      results we conclude that Rac2 has a central role in regulating the Drosophila 
      homeostatic system.

TI  - Exposure to the environmental pollutant bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) 
      causes cell over-proliferation in Drosophila.
PG  - 25261-25270
LID - 10.1007/s11356-020-08899-7 [doi]
AB  - Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE), a derivative of bisphenol A (BPA), is 
      widely used in the manufacture of epoxy resins as well as a coating on food 
      containers. Recent studies have demonstrated the adverse effects of BADGE on 
      reproduction and development in rodents and amphibians, but how BADGE affects 
      biological activity is not understood. To gain a better understanding of the 
      biological effects of BADGE exposure during development, we used the model 
      organism Drosophila melanogaster and performed whole transcriptome sequencing. 
      Interestingly, when Drosophila are raised on food containing BADGE, genes having 
      significantly increased transcript numbers are enriched for those involved in 
      regulating cell proliferation, including DNA replication and cell cycle control. 
      Furthermore, raising larvae on BADGE-containing food induces hemocyte (blood 
      cell) over-proliferation. This effect can be stimulated with even lower 
      concentrations of BADGE if the hemocytes are already primed for cell 
      proliferation by the expression of dominant active Ras GTPase. We conclude that 
      chronic exposure to the xenobiotic BADGE throughout development can induce cell 
      proliferation.

AB  - Heterotrimeric G proteins perform a crucial role as molecular switches 
      controlling various cellular responses mediated by G protein-coupled receptor 
      (GPCR) signaling pathway. Recent data have shown that the vertebrate-like G 
      protein families are found across metazoans and their closest unicellular 
      relatives. However, an overall evolutionary hierarchy of vertebrate-like G 
      proteins, including gene family annotations and in particular mapping individual 
      gene gain/loss events across diverse holozoan lineages is still incomplete. Here, 
      with more expanded invertebrate taxon sampling, we have reconstructed 
      phylogenetic trees for each of the G protein classes/families and provide a 
      robust classification and hierarchy of vertebrate-like heterotrimeric G proteins. 
      Our results further extend the evidence that the common ancestor (CA) of 
      holozoans had at least five ancestral Gα genes corresponding to all major 
      vertebrate Gα classes and contain a total of eight genes including two Gβ and one 
      Gγ. Our results also indicate that the GNAI/O-like gene likely duplicated in the 
      last CA of metazoans to give rise to GNAI- and GNAO-like genes, which are 
      conserved across invertebrates. Moreover, homologs of GNB1-4 paralogon- and GNB5 
      family-like genes are found in most metazoans and that the unicellular holozoans 
      encode two ancestral Gβ genes. Similarly, most bilaterian invertebrates encode 
      two Gγ genes which include a representative of the GNG gene cluster and a 
      putative homolog of GNG13. Interestingly, our results also revealed key 
      evolutionary events such as the Drosophila melanogaster eye specific Gβ subunit 
      that is found conserved in most arthropods and several previously unidentified 
      species specific expansions within Gαi/o, Gαs, Gαq, Gα12/13 classes and the 
      GNB1-4 paralogon. Also, we provide an overall proposed evolutionary scenario on 
      the expansions of all G protein families in vertebrate tetraploidizations. Our 
      robust classification/hierarchy is essential to further understand the 
      differential roles of GPCR/G protein mediated intracellular signaling system 
      across various metazoan lineages.

TI  - Dibutyl Phthalate Exposure Disrupts Evolutionarily Conserved Insulin and 
      Glucagon-Like Signaling in Drosophila Males.
PG  - 2309-21
LID - 10.1210/en.2015-2006 [doi]
AB  - Phthalate diesters are commonly used as industrial plasticisers, as well as in 
      cosmetics and skin care products, as a result people are constantly exposed to 
      these xenobiotics. Recent epidemiological studies have found a correlation 
      between circulating phthalate levels and type 2 diabetes, whereas animal studies 
      indicate that phthalates are capable of disrupting endocrine signaling. 
      Nonetheless, how phthalates interfere with metabolic function is still unclear. 
      Here, we show that feeding Drosophila males the xenobiotic dibutyl phthalate 
      (DBP) affects conserved insulin- and glucagon-like signaling. We report that 
      raising flies on food containing DBP leads to starvation resistance, increased 
      lipid storage, hyperglycemia, and hyperphagia. We go on to show that the 
      starvation-resistance phenotype can be rescued by overexpression of the glucagon 
      analogue adipokinetic hormone (Akh). Furthermore, although acute DBP exposure in 
      adult flies is able to affect insulin levels, only chronic feeding influences Akh 
      expression. We establish that raising flies on DBP-containing food or feeding 
      adults DBP food affects the expression of homologous genes involved in xenobiotic 
      and lipid metabolism (AHR [Drosophila ss], NR1I2 [Hr96], ABCB1 [MDR50], ABCC3 
      [MRP], and CYP3A4 [Cyp9f2]). Finally, we determined that the expression of these 
      genes is also influenced by Akh. Our results provide comprehensive evidence that 
      DBP can disrupt metabolism in Drosophila males, by regulating genes involved in 
      glucose, lipid, and xenobiotic metabolism.

TI  - The Obesity-Linked Gene Nudt3 Drosophila Homolog Aps Is Associated With Insulin 
      Signaling.
PG  - 1303-19
LID - 10.1210/ME.2015-1077 [doi]
AB  - Several genome-wide association studies have linked the Nudix hydrolase family 
      member nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X motif 3 (NUDT3) to obesity. 
      However, the manner of NUDT3 involvement in obesity is unknown, and NUDT3 
      expression, regulation, and signaling in the central nervous system has not been 
      studied. We performed an extensive expression analysis in mice, as well as 
      knocked down the Drosophila NUDT3 homolog Aps in the nervous system, to determine 
      its effect on metabolism. Detailed in situ hybridization studies in the mouse 
      brain revealed abundant Nudt3 mRNA and protein expression throughout the brain, 
      including reward- and feeding-related regions of the hypothalamus and amygdala, 
      whereas Nudt3 mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated in the hypothalamus 
      and brainstem of food-deprived mice. Knocking down Aps in the Drosophila central 
      nervous system, or a subset of median neurosecretory cells, known as the 
      insulin-producing cells (IPCs), induces hyperinsulinemia-like phenotypes, 
      including a decrease in circulating trehalose levels as well as significantly 
      decreasing all carbohydrate levels under starvation conditions. Moreover, 
      lowering Aps IPC expression leads to a decreased ability to recruit these lipids 
      during starvation. Also, loss of neuronal Aps expression caused a starvation 
      susceptibility phenotype while inducing hyperphagia. Finally, the loss of IPC Aps 
      lowered the expression of Akh, Ilp6, and Ilp3, genes known to be inhibited by 
      insulin signaling. These results point toward a role for this gene in the 
      regulation of insulin signaling, which could explain the robust association with 
      obesity in humans.

TI  - Transient Administration of Dopaminergic Precursor Causes Inheritable Overfeeding 
      Behavior in Young Drosophila melanogaster Adults.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci10080487 [doi]
LID - 487
AB  - Imbalances in dopaminergic signaling during development have been indicated as 
      part of the underlying neurobiology of several psychiatric illnesses, including 
      schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, and food addiction. Yet, how 
      transient manipulation of dopaminergic signaling influences long-lasting 
      behavioral consequences, or if these modifications can induce inheritable traits, 
      it is still not understood. In this study, we used the Drosophila melanogaster 
      model to test if transient pharmacological activation of the dopaminergic system 
      leads to modulations of feeding and locomotion in adult flies. We observed that 
      transient administration of a dopaminergic precursor, levodopa, at 6 h, 3 days or 
      5 days post-eclosion, induced overfeeding behavior, while we did not find 
      significant effects on locomotion. Moreover, this phenotype was inherited by the 
      offspring of flies treated 6 h or 3 days post-eclosion, but not the offspring of 
      those treated 5 days post-eclosion. These results indicate that transient 
      alterations in dopaminergic signaling can produce behavioral alterations in 
      adults, which can then be carried to descendants. These findings provide novel 
      insights into the conditions in which environmental factors can produce 
      transgenerational eating disorders.

TI  - Regulation of aggression by obesity-linked genes TfAP-2 and Twz through 
      octopamine signaling in Drosophila.
PG  - 349-62
LID - 10.1534/genetics.113.158402 [doi]
AB  - In Drosophila, the monoamine octopamine, through mechanisms that are not 
      completely understood, regulates both aggression and mating behavior. 
      Interestingly, our study demonstrates that the Drosophila obesity-linked homologs 
      Transcription factor AP-2 (TfAP-2; TFAP2B in humans) and Tiwaz (Twz; KCTD15 in 
      humans) interact to modify male behavior by controlling the expression of 
      Tyramine β-hydroxylase and Vesicular monanime transporter, genes necessary for 
      octopamine production and secretion. Furthermore, we reveal that octopamine in 
      turn regulates aggression through the Drosophila cholecystokinin satiation 
      hormone homolog Drosulfakinin (Dsk). Finally, we establish that TfAP-2 is 
      expressed in octopaminergic neurons known to control aggressive behavior and that 
      TfAP-2 requires functional Twz for its activity. We conclude that genetically 
      manipulating the obesity-linked homologs TfAP-2 and Twz is sufficient to affect 
      octopamine signaling, which in turn modulates Drosophila male behavior through 
      the regulation of the satiation hormone Dsk.

      and human beings are exposed to DEHP via polyvinyl chloride (PVC) materials, 
      medical equipment and even drinking water. While DEHP has been implicated to 
      influence metabolism and endocrine functions, important questions remain about 
      the molecular mechanisms of these effects. We employed the model organism 
      Drosophila melanogaster and examined physiological, molecular and behavioural 
      effects from DEHP-contaminated food. We found that DEHP, at levels comparable to 
      human exposure, made male flies more resistant to starvation and increased lipid 
      levels, while decreasing circulating carbohydrates. Moreover, DEHP-fed male flies 
      had higher expression levels of an insulin-like peptide known to regulate 
      metabolism, as well as the insulin receptor. Our results suggest that long-term 
      DEHP feeding may induce diabetes-like dysfunctions. These findings provide a 
      molecular background of how DEHP may have detrimental effects on metabolic 
      functions.

AB  - Exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) in rodents was shown to induce obesity, yet the 
      mechanism by which BPA might induce obesity is still unclear. We employed the 
      genetically tractable model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, to test the 
      effects of raising them on food containing various concentrations of BPA. Of 
      note, raising males on food containing BPA were susceptible to starvation, 
      possibly by inhibiting their ability to perform lipolysis during starvation, 
      leading to significantly increased lipid content after 24 hr of fasting. 
      Furthermore, feeding males with BPA significantly inhibited the expression of 
      insulin-like peptides. From these results, we conclude that BPA may inhibit lipid 
      recruitment during starvation in Drosophila.

TI  - The repertoire of G-protein-coupled receptors in fully sequenced genomes.
PG  - 1414-25
AB  - The superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is one of the largest and 
      most studied families of proteins. We created Hidden Markov Models derived from 
      sorted groups of GPCRs from our previous detailed phylogenetic classification of 
      human GPCRs and added several other models derived from receptors not found in 
      mammals. We used these models to search entire Genscan data sets from 13 species 
      whose genomes are nearly completely sequenced. We found more than 5000 unique 
      GPCRs that were divided into 15 main groups, and the largest one, the Rhodopsin 
      family, was subdivided into 13 subclasses. The results show that the main 
      families in the human genome, Glutamate, Rhodopsin, Adhesion, Frizzled, and 
      Secretin, arose before the split of nematodes from the chordate lineage. 
      Moreover, several of the subgroups of the Rhodopsin family arose before the split 
      of the linage leading to vertebrates. We also searched expressed sequence tag 
      (EST) databases and identified more than 20,000 sequences that match GPCRs. 
      Although the GPCRs represent typically 1 to 2% of the Genscan predictions, the 
      ESTs that match GPCRs are typically only 0.01 to 0.001%, indicating that GPCRs in 
      most of the groups are expressed at low levels. We also provide searchable data 
      sets that may be used for annotation and further detailed analysis of the GPCR 
      family. This study provides an extensive overview of the expansion of the gene 
      repertoire for families and subgroups of GPCRs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is a growing global concern with strong associations with 
      cardiovascular disease, cancer and type-2 diabetes. Although various genome-wide 
      association studies have identified more than 40 genes associated with obesity, 
      these genes cannot fully explain the heritability of obesity, suggesting there 
      may be other contributing factors, including epigenetic effects. RESULTS: We 
      performed genome wide DNA methylation profiling comparing normal-weight and obese 
      9-13 year old children to investigate possible epigenetic changes correlated with 
      obesity. Of note, obese children had significantly lower methylation levels at a 
      CpG site located near coronin 7 (CORO7), which encodes a tryptophan-aspartic acid 
      dipeptide (WD)-repeat containing protein most likely involved in Golgi complex 
      morphology and function. Anatomical profiling of coronin 7 (Coro7) mRNA 
      expression in mice revealed that it is highly expressed in appetite and energy 
      balance regulating regions, including the hypothalamus, striatum and locus 
      coeruleus, the main noradrenergic brain site. Interestingly, we found that food 
      deprivation in mice downregulates hypothalamic Coro7 mRNA levels, and injecting 
      ethanol, an appetite stimulant, increased the number of Coro7 expressing cells in 
      the locus coeruleus. Finally, by employing the genetically-tractable Drosophila 
      melanogaster model we were able to demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved 
      metabolic function for the CORO7 homologue pod1. Knocking down the pod1 in the 
      Drosophila adult nervous system increased their resistance to starvation. 
      Furthermore, feeding flies a high-calorie diet significantly increased pod1 
      expression. CONCLUSION: We conclude that coronin 7 is involved in the regulation 
      of energy homeostasis and this role stems, to some degree, from the effect on 
      feeding for calories and reward.

TI  - The repertoire of trace amine G-protein-coupled receptors: large expansion in 
      zebrafish.
PG  - 470-82
AB  - Trace amines, such as tyramine, beta-phenylethylamine, tryptamine, and 
      octopamine, are present in trace levels in nervous systems and bind a specific 
      family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), but the function or origin of this 
      system is not well understood. We searched the genomes of several eukaryotic 
      species for receptors similar to the mammalian trace amine (TA) receptor 
      subfamily. We identified 18 new receptors in rodents that are orthologous to the 
      previously known TA-receptors. Remarkably, we found 57 receptors (and 40 
      pseudogenes) of this type in the zebrafish (Danio rerio), while fugu (Takifugu 
      rubripes) had only eight receptors (and seven pseudogenes). We mapped 47 of the 
      zebrafish TA-receptors on chromosomes using radiation hybrid panels and meiotic 
      mapping. The results, together with the degree of conservation and phylogenetic 
      relationships displayed among the zebrafish receptors suggest that the family 
      arose through several different mechanisms involving tetraploidization, block 
      duplications, and local duplication events. Interestingly, these vertebrate 
      TA-receptors do not show a close evolutionary relationship to the invertebrate 
      TA-binding receptors in fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster), indicating that the 
      ability to bind TA have evolved at least twice in animal evolution. We collected 
      in total over 100 vertebrate TA-receptor sequences, and our phylogenetic analysis 
      shows that several TA-receptors have evolved rapidly with remarkable species 
      variation and that the common ancestor of vertebrate TA-receptors arose before 
      the split of the ray-finned and lobe-finned fishes. The evolutionary history of 
      the TA-receptors is more complex than for most other GPCR families and here we 
      suggest a mechanism by which they may have arisen.

AB  - BACKGROUND: GPR125 belongs to the family of Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors 
      (GPCRs). A single copy of GPR125 was found in many vertebrate genomes. We also 
      identified a Drosophila sequence, DmCG15744, which shares a common ancestor with 
      the entire Group III of Adhesion GPCRs, and also contains Ig, LRR and HBD domains 
      which were observed in mammalian GPR125. RESULTS: We found specific expression of 
      GPR125 in cells of the choroid plexus using in situ hybridization and 
      protein-specific antibodies and combined in situ/immunohistochemistry 
      co-localization using cytokeratin, a marker specific for epithelial cells. 
      Induction of inflammation by LPS did not change GPR125 expression. However, 
      GPR125 expression was transiently increased (almost 2-fold) at 4 h after 
      traumatic brain injury (TBI) followed by a decrease (approximately 4-fold) from 2 
      days onwards in the choroid plexus as well as increased expression (2-fold) in 
      the hippocampus that was delayed until 1 day after injury. CONCLUSION: These 
      findings suggest that GPR125 plays a functional role in choroidal and hippocampal 
      response to injury.

TI  - Insulin receptor-like ectodomain genes and splice variants are found in both 
      arthropods and human brain cDNA.
PG  - 664-670
AB  - Truncated receptor ectodomains have been described for several classes of cell 
      surface receptors, including those that bind to growth factors, cytokines, 
      immunoglobulins, and adhesion molecules. Soluble receptor isoforms are typically 
      generated by proteolytic cleavage of the cell surface receptor or by alternative 
      splicing of RNA transcripts arising from the same gene encoding the full-length 
      receptor. Both the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the insulin 
      receptor (INSR) families produce soluble receptor splice variants in vertebrates 
      and truncated forms of insulin receptor-like sequences have previously been 
      described in Drosophila. The EGFR and INSR ectodomains share significant sequence 
      homology with each other suggestive of a common evolutionary origin. We 
      discovered novel truncated insulin receptor-like variants in several arthropod 
      species. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of the conserved extracellular 
      receptor L1 and L2 subdomains in invertebrate species. While the segregation of 
      insulin receptor-like L1 and L2 domains indicated that an internal domain 
      duplication had occurred only once, the generation of truncated insulin 
      receptor-like sequences has occurred multiple times. The significance of this 
      work is the previously unknown and widespread occurrence of truncated isoforms in 
      arthropods, signifying that these isoforms play an important functional role, 
      potentially related to such isoforms in mammals.
